# 🎲 Tenzies Game - React Project

This is a simple dice game built with React as part of the **Scrimba React Course** final project.

## 🕹️ How to Play

- Roll the dice until all dice show the same number.
- Click on individual dice to "hold" their current value.
- Continue rolling until all held dice match.

This project helped me practice:
- React state management (`useState`)
- Conditional rendering
- Component props and mapping
- Basic game logic in a React app
